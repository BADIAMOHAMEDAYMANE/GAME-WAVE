## ➕ Adding a New Game

1. **Add the game files** to `public/games/<GameName>/`
2. **Add a thumbnail** image to `src/assets/`
3. **Register the game** in `src/data/games.js`:

```js
{
  id: 18,
  title: "My New Game",
  image: myGameImg,
  gamePath: "/games/MyNewGame/index.html",
  isNew: true
}
```

That's it — the game card, hero carousel eligibility, and routing are all handled automatically.

- Responsive breakpoints cover mobile portrait/landscape, tablet, and desktop
